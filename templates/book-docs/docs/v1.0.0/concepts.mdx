Before diving into content creation, it helps to understand a few core concepts that shape how the platform works.

## MDX

MDX is Markdown with components. You write standard Markdown and can embed rich, interactive components directly in your content.

```mdx
# Regular Markdown

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.

<Callout type="tip">
  And this is an interactive component inside Markdown!
</Callout>
```

<Callout type="info">
  All documentation files use the `.mdx` extension, not `.md`.
</Callout>

## Frontmatter

Every page starts with frontmatter — a YAML block at the top of the file that defines metadata:

```mdx
---
title: Page Title
description: A short description for SEO
sidebar_position: 1
icon: book
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | Page title shown in sidebar and browser tab |
| `description` | Recommended | Short description for search engines |
| `sidebar_position` | No | Controls order in sidebar (lower number = higher up) |
| `icon` | No | Lucide icon name for the sidebar |
| `tags` | No | Array of tags for categorization |

## Versioning

Documentation is organized by version. Each version lives in its own folder:

```txt
docs/
├── v1.0.0/    # Stable release
├── v2.0.0/    # Next major release
└── next/      # Development docs
```

Users can switch between versions using the version selector in the header.

## Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar is automatically generated from your folder structure. You control the order and appearance using:

- **`sidebar_position`** in frontmatter — sets page order
- **`_category_.json`** in folders — configures section labels and behavior

```json
{
  "label": "Getting Started",
  "position": 1,
  "collapsible": true,
  "collapsed": false
}
```

## Components

The platform includes a library of built-in components that you can use without any imports:

<CardGrid cols={3}>
  <Card icon="message-square" title="Callouts" description="Highlight important info" />
  <Card icon="layers" title="Tabs" description="Tabbed content panels" />
  <Card icon="list" title="Steps" description="Step-by-step guides" />
  <Card icon="grid" title="Cards" description="Feature cards with icons" />
  <Card icon="code" title="Code Blocks" description="Syntax-highlighted code" />
  <Card icon="chevrons-up-down" title="Accordion" description="Collapsible sections" />
</CardGrid>
