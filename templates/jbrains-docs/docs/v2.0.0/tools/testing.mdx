This page covers strategies for testing your documentation site to ensure content renders correctly and the build succeeds.

## Build Verification

The simplest test is to run a production build and check for errors:

<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <Tab label="npm">
```bash
npm run build
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="yarn">
```bash
yarn build
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm build
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The build will fail if:
- MDX files have syntax errors
- Frontmatter is malformed
- Required fields are missing

<Callout type="tip">
  Run `npm run build` in your CI pipeline to catch documentation errors before they reach production.
</Callout>

## Type Checking

Verify TypeScript types are correct:

```bash
npm run check
```

This catches type errors in your SvelteKit configuration and any custom components.

## Content Checklist

When reviewing documentation changes, verify:

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontmatter** | All pages have `title`, and key pages have `description` |
| **Links** | Internal links point to existing pages |
| **Versions** | Content exists in all active version directories |
| **Sidebar Order** | `sidebar_position` values create a logical reading flow |
| **Categories** | Each folder has a `_category_.json` with `label` and `position` |

## Visual Testing

Preview the site locally and check:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Dev Server">
    Run `npm run dev` and open the site in your browser.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Navigation">
    Verify sidebar links work, breadcrumbs are correct, and previous/next navigation follows the expected order.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Themes">
    Toggle between light and dark themes. Ensure all content is readable in both modes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Responsive">
    Test on different viewport sizes. The mobile sidebar should collapse into a menu.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

### Frontmatter Parsing Errors

```
Error: Invalid frontmatter in docs/v2.0.0/page.mdx
```

Ensure your frontmatter uses valid YAML syntax and is enclosed by `---` delimiters.

### Missing Pages

If a page doesn't appear in the sidebar:

1. Check the file has the `.mdx` extension (not `.md`)
2. Verify the file is in the correct version directory
3. Check if `draft: true` is set in frontmatter

### Broken Links

If internal links return 404:

1. Check the path matches the file structure
2. Include the version prefix: `/docs/v2.0.0/page-name`
3. Use the file's slug (filename without `.mdx`), not the title

  The dev server shows detailed error messages in the browser overlay. Check the terminal output for build-time errors.
