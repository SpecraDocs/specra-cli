This page explains how navigation flow works in the documentation system — how users move between pages and how you control the reading path.

## Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar is the primary navigation mechanism. It is automatically generated from the file and folder structure in `docs/`:

```txt
docs/v1.0.0/
├── home.mdx                  → Top-level page
├── getting-started.mdx       → Top-level page
├── basics/
│   ├── _category_.json       → Section configuration
│   ├── syntax.mdx            → Page in section
│   ├── types.mdx             → Page in section
│   └── control-flow.mdx      → Page in section
```

Pages are sorted by `sidebar_position`, then alphabetically.

## Previous/Next Navigation

At the bottom of each page, previous and next links are automatically generated based on the sidebar order. This creates a linear reading path through the documentation.

<Callout type="tip">
  Design your `sidebar_position` values to create a logical reading flow from introduction to advanced topics.

## Tab Groups

Tab groups split the sidebar into separate tabbed sections. This is useful when documentation covers distinct but related areas:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabGroups": [
      { "id": "language", "label": "Language" },
      { "id": "multiplatform", "label": "Multiplatform" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Assign categories to tab groups in `_category_.json`:

```json
{
  "label": "Basics",
  "tab_group": "language"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Pages not assigned to any tab group appear in all tabs. Use tab groups to separate conceptually different areas of documentation.
</Callout>

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs show the user's current position in the documentation hierarchy:

```
Home > Basics > Control Flow
```

Enable or disable breadcrumbs in configuration:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "showBreadcrumbs": true
  }
}
```

## Version Switching

Users can switch between documentation versions using the version selector in the header. The system attempts to navigate to the same page in the selected version.

## Linking Between Pages

Use standard Markdown links with the full path:

```markdown
[Getting Started](/docs/v1.0.0/getting-started)
[Basic Syntax](/docs/v1.0.0/basics/syntax)
```

### Cross-Version Links

```markdown
[See v2.0.0 docs](/docs/v2.0.0/getting-started)
```

## Cards as Navigation

Use CardGrid for hub pages that direct users to different sections:

<CardGrid cols={2}>
  <Card icon="code" title="Basic Syntax" description="The fundamental building blocks" href="/docs/v1.0.0/basics/syntax" />
  <Card icon="layers" title="Types & Variables" description="Type system and declarations" href="/docs/v1.0.0/basics/types" />
</CardGrid>
